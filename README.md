# Real-Time Gender Classification using Webcam

This project uses a real-time video feed from a webcam to classify individuals as male or female. The classification is powered by a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and built using TensorFlow.

## Features
- **Real-time classification**: Uses OpenCV to capture live video from the webcam.
- **Deep learning-based model**: Implements a CNN to classify gender from images.
- **Optimized performance**: Achieves efficient real-time performance with high accuracy.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **OpenCV**: For video capture and image processing.
- **TensorFlow**: For model creation and training.
