Real-Time Gender Classification using Webcam
This project uses a real-time video feed from a webcam to classify individuals as male or female. The classification is done using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image recognition and TensorFlow for the model's training and prediction.

Features:
Real-time classification: Uses OpenCV to capture live video from the webcam.
Deep learning-based model: Implements a CNN to process and classify gender from webcam images.
Optimized performance: Achieves efficient real-time performance with a high accuracy rate.
